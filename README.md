# http_injection_tool
This tool simulates HTTP response injection attacks for ethical hacking, security testing, and education. It allows users to inject payloads like XSS, JavaScript redirects, cookie stealing, and defacement. Users can also upload custom HTML for website defacement and inject it into the response body.
